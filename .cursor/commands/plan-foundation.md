# Plan Foundation

Create a comprehensive FOUNDATION.MD document that defines the core problem, vision, and strategic direction for a software project.

## INPUT

**Required Information:**

- Problem statement and who experiences it
- Current solutions and their limitations
- Proposed solution and key benefits
- Project scope (in/out/future)
- Target users and stakeholders
- Constraints (technical, business, design)
- Success criteria and metrics
- Key assumptions and risks

**Reference:** See `.cursor/commands/references/foundation-guide.md` for detailed guidance on role, behavior, questions to ask, and quality standards.

## PROCESS

1. **Research Phase**
   - Ask clarifying questions about the problem space (if needed)
   - Gather concrete examples and use cases
   - Validate assumptions with the user
   - Understand constraints and context

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Synthesize responses into clear problem statement
   - Define solution vision and key benefits
   - Establish scope boundaries (in/out/future)
   - Identify measurable success criteria

3. **Document Generation**
   - Create FOUNDATION.MD with structured sections
   - Ensure all content is specific and actionable
   - Include risks, assumptions, and open questions
   - Maintain consistency across all sections

4. **Review & Refinement**
   - Present draft for user feedback
   - Address vague statements or gaps
   - Iterate until document is clear and complete
   - Verify alignment between vision, scope, and metrics

## OUTPUT

Generate `FOUNDATION.MD` in the repository root containing:

- **Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentence project overview
- **Problem Statement**: The problem, who has it, current solutions
- **Vision**: Your solution, key benefits, success criteria
- **Scope**: What's in/out of scope, future considerations
- **Users & Stakeholders**: Primary users and stakeholders with goals
- **Constraints**: Technical, business, and design limitations
- **Success Metrics**: KPIs and acceptance criteria
- **Risks & Assumptions**: Key assumptions and identified risks
- **Open Questions**: Unresolved items requiring answers

The document should be scannable, specific, actionable, and complete.
