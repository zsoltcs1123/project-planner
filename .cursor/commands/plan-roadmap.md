# Plan Roadmap

Create a comprehensive ROADMAP.MD document that breaks down the project into logical phases with clear deliverables, dependencies, and value progression.

## INPUT

**Required Information:**

- Logical phases and what each delivers
- Value proposition for each phase
- Dependencies between components/phases
- Key milestones and success criteria
- Risks and mitigation strategies per phase
- Learning objectives between phases
- Resource considerations

**Reference:** See `.cursor/commands/references/roadmap-guide.md` for detailed guidance on role, behavior, questions to ask, and quality standards.

## PROCESS

1. **Phase Definition**
   - Break project into logical phases
   - Define what each phase delivers
   - Identify value delivered to users/stakeholders
   - Ensure phases are right-sized (not too big/small)

2. **Sequencing & Dependencies**
   - Determine what must be built first
   - Identify parallel work opportunities
   - Map dependencies between components
   - Consider technical and organizational constraints

3. **Risk & Learning**
   - Identify risks for each phase
   - Define mitigation strategies
   - Plan learning objectives between phases
   - Build in adaptation points

4. **Documentation**
   - Create ROADMAP.MD with clear phase breakdown
   - Show progression of value delivery
   - Document dependencies and sequencing rationale
   - Include milestones and success criteria

## OUTPUT

Generate `ROADMAP.MD` in the repository root containing:

- **Roadmap Overview**: High-level phasing strategy and rationale
- **Phase Breakdown**: Each phase with deliverables and value
- **Dependencies**: What blocks what, sequencing constraints
- **Milestones**: Key checkpoints and success criteria
- **Value Progression**: How value builds across phases
- **Risks & Mitigation**: Phase-specific risks and strategies
- **Learning & Adaptation**: What you learn and how you adapt
- **Future Phases**: Longer-term considerations beyond initial release

The document should be methodology-agnostic, phase-focused, and adaptable to your team's workflow.
